I'm an oil man ladies and gentlemen.

I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. I hate most people.

One night, I'm gonna come to you, inside of your house, wherever you're sleeping, and I'm going to cut your throat.

Drainage! Draaaainage! !USERNAME , you boy! Drained dry.

If you have a milkshake, and I have a milkshake, and I have a straw..Watch it. Now my straw reaches acroooossss the room, and starts to drink your milkshake. I drink your milkshake! I DRINK IT UP!

Did you just tell me how to run my family?

I see the worst in people, !USERNAME . I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need. I've built up my hatreds over the years, little by little.

Look at me !USERNAME. You're lower than a bastard. You have none of me in you. You're just a bastard from a basket.

I'm gonna bury you underground !USERNAME

I've abandoned my child! I've abandoned my child! I've abandoned my boy!

You're not the chosen brother, !USERNAME . It was Paul who was chosen. Yes, he-he found me and he told me about your land. You're just a fool.

They should've put you in a glass jar on the mantelpiece. Where were you when Paul was sucking at his mother's teat? Where were you? Who was nursing you, poor !USERNAME

There's a whole ocean of oil under our feet! No one can get at it except for me!

Can I build around 50 miles of Tehachapi mountains? Don't be thick in front of me !USERNAME

Did you think your song and dance and your superstition would help you !USERNAME ? I am the Third Revelation! I am who the Lord has chosen!

I do my own drilling, and the men that work for me, work for me.

Aren't you a healer and a vessel for the holy spirit? !USERNAME When are you coming over and make my son hear again? Can't you do that?

You look like a fool, don't you !USERNAME ?
